# ðŸ“š Guestbook

This simple project was the result of my studies about `Flask` from Pretty Printed's [_Intro to Flask_](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLXmMXHVSvS-AjwTOtiW1DXFYTgUlrUmHV&si=lBWoNpVA6nIfCqzY) playlist.

This will serve as my reference to my future Flask projects; this repository contains topics such as:
- Simple routing
- Rendering with Jinja
- Connecting to databases
